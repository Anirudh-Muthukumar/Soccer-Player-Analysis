# Soccer-Player-Analysis
This script employs machine learning methods to train a model for clustering players from with similar style of play which makes it easy to perform analysis. Once players are grouped, it is possible to identify which group can coach the other group on those attributes which the other the group lacks. It also computes which factors affect the overall rating of the players and helps the individual player to hone such skills to stay on top. It also makes the job of team coach easier to decide on the position of a new player by comparing his/her graph with that of already clustered group.
